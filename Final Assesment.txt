1)  BVT:BVT means Built Verification Testing.which is a set of tests process.which is used to verify new built before it's testing.BVT is automated.
    DEFECTS LIFE CYCLE:defects is going through its lifetime proces.which is avctually start when defect is found and end when defect is closed.

2)   TEST PROCESS:Testing is the process of evaluating whether the system or its components satiesfies the requirements or not.like erros or any other defects are happened and then it check and verify.
